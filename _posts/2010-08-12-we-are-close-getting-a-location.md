title: We are close to nailing down a location
---

We think that the location, where the conference is going to take place, is the most important thing to have.

So when we started to organize, we have put "Get a location" on the very top of our schedule. And after some brainstorming we've revealed a whole bunch of exciting, astonishing and excellent locations in Berlin. There are lots of decent ones, but we want to make it something special.

Tim has found the location. After telling us some details about the building and the space we could use, we were immediately excited!
**So far I want to tell you:** The location is a cinema. And the space it offers fits perfectly what we call an impressive conference venue.

In parallel we also decided over the appropriate legal structure to cover the organization of the conference.
That means both preconditions for having a deal with a location (choosing one and being a formely accepted organization) are nailed.

The current state is very exciting, because we are currently moving into the "discussing details" phase with this really amazing location! (I can't wait to publish some images to give this mouth watering writing some more impressions)

But we have lots of other things to organize as well, and our organisation wiki is growing and growing.
For this reason we try to have a fixed/contracted location around **9th of September**.
