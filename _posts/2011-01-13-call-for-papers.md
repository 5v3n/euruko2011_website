I'm very happy to announce the Call for Papers for the EuRuKo 2011. This summer (28th to 29th of May) we are going to have yet another amazing community built conference, in the middle of Europes most happening city Berlin.

Say, you have researched something about Ruby, developed a gem, found a unique usage for Ruby or you had a life challenging experience with Ruby. What would be a better opportunity to talk about it on the European Ruby conference?
We would love to hear from you!

**Submit your talk proposal until 22nd of February to [talks@euruko2011.org](mailto:talks@euruko2011.org).**
Please include a short description of what you'd like to present and your resident country. If you add some personal information and your contact details, that would be very helpful.

After the deadline, we will do our best to pick the most interesting proposals. You will be notified about your submission, and the choosen talks are going to be presented on the website.
If you receive a positive response, we will refund you a previously bought ticket.

Following the good habits of the past years, talks are lined up on a single track.
The length of each talk shall be 30 minutes including Q&A.

Again, the deadline for the call for papers is **22nd of February, 2011**.

Cheers!
