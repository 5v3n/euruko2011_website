title: The first batch of tickets is available
---

Today, we'd like to tell you about the ticket sale we have in mind.
First of all there will be two types of tickets.

This first batch of 30 tickets, wich will be available by today, are **Supporter tickets**. Those tickets can be bought for the price of 357 € _(including VAT, that is 300 € excluding german VAT)_.

If you decide to buy a supporter ticket, you will **become an official supporter for this years EuRuKo**. Supporters will be able to attend the conference and they have the chance to send us their logo, which will be linked and shown on the website.

The next batch of tickets will already be the regular tickets. Therefore this is your only chance to become a supporter of the EuRuKo 2011!
At this point in time, we can't tell you what price the regular tickets will be. We are still working on the regular ticket price to make it as low as possible. We want to create an event that is easily affordable for everyone in the Ruby community.

And more is in the queue: The upcoming blog post, we have in mind will inform you about the next steps we are going to take. This includes information about ticket pricing, buying dates and some more information about our amazing venue. If you don't know already, this EuRuKo will take place in a cinema!

Last but not least, we would also like to thank our supporter [Linkingpaths](http://linkingpaths.com/). Those are the smart minds behind the event booking application [StageHQ](http://www.stagehq.com/). Thank you guys for providing StageHQ for this event. It really helped us getting the booking stuff done in no time!
